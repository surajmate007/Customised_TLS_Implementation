# Customised_TLS_Implementation
In this project I have implemented customised TLS to securely communnicate the OTP between bank and client.

How to Run this code:
1. First open three terminals and run my_ttp.py file using python3 my_ttp.py command.
2. Run my_server.py. Give the name of the server you want. Then similarly run my_client.py and give the name of the client you want.
3. Then you have to input the cipher suite ie. RSA, AES, CHACHA20 and SHA256, SHA384.
4. Then input the country code and all certification details as input in the server terminal.
5. Similarly input all certification details as input in the client terminal.
6. Then automatically verification and message exchange will be done.


Difficulties I have faced :
    Many times the implementation of some functionality from one library is good but the related functionality from other library gives an error. As I mentioned earlier padding and unpadding from cryptography was giving erroneous output then specifically using these functionalities from some other library becomes hectic mostly due to compatibility issues.
The same kind of issue I faced during loading and storing the keys and certificates in the directories. Because the formats of storage of one library is good but the keys generated by some other library don’t support that store and load format. Hence it became complete permutation and combination problem.


References:
a) The documentation of libraries are the best references to build the code from scratch. Also special thanks to stack overflow and stack exchange for very good question and answering platform which really resolved many of my doubts and errors.
b) Below is the link of python openSSL documentation it helped me lot in knowing some implementation details of the certificates.

c) The below link is the best reference for my work. The cryptography library has implemented
almost all the algorithms elegantly from key generation to certificate creation.

d) I haven’t used any particular functions from the library mentioned below (Pycryptodome) but padding and unpadding of data during symmetric encryption and decryption gives error in cryptography. Hence, this library served as very good source to overcome this issue.

e) Thanks to Prof. Vireshwar Kumar Sir for clearing all our basics required to implement this
code.
